A modern, responsive personal portfolio built with cutting-edge technologies including Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Astro 5** - Ultra-fast static site generator with islands architecture
- **React 19** - Interactive components with server-side rendering
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework with new oxide engine
- **TypeScript 5.7** - Type-safe development
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Building the Container

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t personal-website .

# Run locally
docker run -p 18475:80 personal-website
```

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Start the container
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the container
docker-compose down
```

## üåê Reverse Proxy Setup

### Option 1: Traefik (Recommended)

The `docker-compose.yml` includes Traefik labels for automatic HTTPS and routing:

1. Ensure Traefik is running on your Unraid server
2. Update the domain in `docker-compose.yml`
3. Deploy with `docker-compose up -d`

### Option 2: Nginx Proxy Manager

1. Comment out Traefik labels in `docker-compose.yml`
2. Use the alternative service configuration
3. Configure routing in Nginx Proxy Manager UI

### Option 3: Manual Nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:18475;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

3. **`docker-deploy.yml`** - Docker-based deployment with health checks

### Self-Hosted Runner Setup

1. Configure a GitHub self-hosted runner on your homelab server
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the runner
3. Set up necessary secrets in GitHub repository settings:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)
   - Any additional deployment secrets

### Deployment Process

**Automatic:**
- Push to `main` branch triggers production deployment
- Pull requests trigger CI checks and preview builds
- Docker images are built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry

**Manual:**
- Use GitHub Actions "Run workflow" for manual deployments
- Choose deployment environment (production/staging)

### Health Checks

- Automated health checks verify deployment success
- Container health monitoring included
- Failure notifications and rollback strategies

## üìä Monitoring
