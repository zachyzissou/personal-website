# Migration Summary: Self-Hosted to GitHub-Hosted Runners

This document summarizes the migration from self-hosted GitHub Actions runners to GitHub-hosted runners with Unraid container deployment.

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before (Self-Hosted Runner Setup)
- ✅ Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on Unraid server
- ✅ Direct deployment to Unraid via runner volume mounts
- ✅ Runner managed container lifecycle
- ❌ Complex setup and maintenance
- ❌ Runner dependency and token management
- ❌ Direct server access required for CI/CD

### After (GitHub-Hosted + Container Deployment)
- ✅ GitHub-hosted runners (no local maintenance)
- ✅ Docker images built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
- ✅ Simple Unraid container deployment
- ✅ Easy updates via image pulls
- ✅ Simplified architecture
- ✅ No local runner management needed

## 🚀 Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Infrastructure**: No more self-hosted runner maintenance
2. **Better Security**: Isolated CI/CD environment
3. **Easier Updates**: Pull latest images instead of complex deployments
4. **More Reliable**: GitHub's infrastructure vs. home lab reliability
5. **Portable**: Same Docker images work anywhere, not just Unraid

## 📋 Migration Steps Completed

### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflows Updated
- **CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`): Now uses `ubuntu-latest` runners
- **Deploy Workflow** (`deploy.yml`): Builds and pushes Docker images to GHCR
- **Docker Deploy Workflow** (`docker-deploy.yml`): Enhanced container builds

### ✅ New Deployment Method
- **Docker Images**: Automatically built and pushed to `ghcr.io/zachyzissou/personal-website`
- **Unraid XML Template**: Ready-to-use template for Community Applications
- **Docker Compose**: Standalone deployment configuration
- **Setup Scripts**: Automated Unraid container setup

### ✅ Documentation Updated
- **UNRAID_DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide (was RUNNER_SETUP.md)
- **README.md**: Updated with new deployment instructions
- **Scripts**: New container-focused setup and management scripts

### ✅ Configuration Fixes
- **Port Mapping**: Corrected to use nginx port 8080
- **Health Checks**: Properly configured for container environment
- **Dependencies**: Fixed Docker build with npx commands

## 🎯 How to Deploy Now

### Quick Start (Recommended)
1. **Use Unraid Template**: Add `unraid-template.xml` to your Docker templates
2. **Configure**: Set port 18475 for web access
3. **Deploy**: Container pulls `ghcr.io/zachyzissou/personal-website:latest`
4. **Access**: Visit `http://your-unraid-ip:18475`

### Manual Deployment
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name personal-website \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 18475:8080 \
  ghcr.io/zachyzissou/personal-website:latest
```

### Automated Setup
```bash
# Download and run setup script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zachyzissou/personal-website/main/scripts/unraid-setup.sh | bash

# Deploy container
cd /mnt/user/appdata/personal-website && ./deploy.sh
```

## 🔄 Update Process

### Before (Self-Hosted)
1. Push code to main branch
2. Runner pulls and builds on Unraid
3. Direct deployment to local paths
4. Complex troubleshooting if issues occur

### After (GitHub-Hosted)
1. **Push code** to main branch
2. **GitHub Actions** builds and pushes new image
3. **Pull update** on Unraid: `docker pull ghcr.io/zachyzissou/personal-website:latest`
4. **Restart container**: `docker-compose up -d`

## 🧹 Cleanup (Optional)

If migrating from the old self-hosted setup:

```bash
# Stop old self-hosted runner
docker stop Docker-Github-Actions-Runner-personal-website
docker rm Docker-Github-Actions-Runner-personal-website

# Clean up old runner data
rm -rf /mnt/user/appdata/github_runner-personal-website

# Remove old deployment (if migrating)
cd /mnt/user/appdata/personal-website
docker-compose down
```

Then deploy using the new method.

## 📊 Comparison

| Aspect | Self-Hosted | GitHub-Hosted |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Setup Complexity | High | Low |
| Maintenance | Ongoing | None |
| Security | Local Access | Isolated |
| Reliability | Home Lab | GitHub Infrastructure |
| Updates | Complex | Simple Pull |
| Troubleshooting | Direct Access | Image-based |
| Portability | Unraid Only | Any Docker Host |

## 🎉 Result

You now have:
- ✅ **Simpler deployment**: No self-hosted runner management
- ✅ **Automatic builds**: GitHub Actions builds on every push
- ✅ **Easy updates**: Simple `docker pull` and restart
- ✅ **Better reliability**: GitHub's infrastructure
- ✅ **Same functionality**: Website works identically
- ✅ **Same ports**: Still accessible on port 18475

The migration maintains all existing functionality while significantly simplifying the infrastructure!
